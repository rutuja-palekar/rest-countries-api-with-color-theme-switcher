Project Title: REST Countries API With Color Theme Switcher



Description: 
This project is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, React JS, and Normalize.css. It utilizes the REST Countries API to provide users with access to a wide range of information about various countries.

The web app offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to explore countries' information effortlessly. On the homepage, users can easily view a list of all countries, search for specific countries, and filter them by region. Clicking on a country provides detailed information on a separate page, including the ability to navigate to border countries.

One of the notable features of this project is the color theme switcher. Users can toggle between light and dark modes to suit their preferences and create a personalized browsing experience. The chosen theme persists even after the web app is reloaded, ensuring consistency for returning users.

By combining the power of the REST Countries API with an intuitive user interface and a customizable color theme switcher, this project provides an engaging and informative experience for users interested in exploring and learning about different countries around the world.
